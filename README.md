About:
Housing ensures that members of society have a place to live, whether it is a home or some kind of physical structure for dwelling, lodging or shelter and it includes a range of options from apartments and houses to temporary shelters and emergency accommodations.[2] Access to safe, affordable, and stable housing is essential for a person's health, safety, and well-being. Housing can also impact a person's economic, social, and cultural opportunities, as it influences their access to education, employment, healthcare, and social networks. In many countries, housing policies and programs have been developed to address issues related to affordability, quality, and availability, and to ensure that everyone has access to decent housing. Some have one or more housing authorities, sometimes also called a housing ministry or housing department.

Support Vector Regression~
Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as SVM in case classification. 
The difference is that if in the case of classification, SVM tries to find the largest 'path' that can separate samples from different classes, then in the case of regression SVR tries to find a path that can accommodate as many samples as possible in the 'path'.
